# BlogPost Website

This project is aimed at learning and solidifying knowledge about building a RESTful API backend using Node.js and Express, with potential integration with a frontend using React.

## Overview

The BlogPost website is a simple blogging platform where users can create, publish, and interact with blog posts. It provides a RESTful API backend built with Node.js and Express, allowing for CRUD operations on posts and comments.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (with Mongoose)
  
- **Frontend** (potentially):
  - React.js

## Features

  - Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for blog posts.
  - Mark posts as published or unpublished.

- **Comment System**:
  - Users can leave comments on blog posts.
  - CRUD operations for comments.


## Learning Goals

This project serves as a practical learning experience for:

- Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express.
- Integrating MongoDB as a NoSQL database using Mongoose.
- Implementing CRUD operations for managing data.
- Potentially integrating a frontend using React for a full-stack application experience.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the desire to learn and grow skills in web development. Special thanks to the project Odin, numerous online tutorials, documentation, and resources available for learning Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React.
