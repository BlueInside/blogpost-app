# BlogPost Website

This project is aimed at learning and solidifying knowledge about building a RESTful API backend using Node.js and Express, with potential integration with a frontend using React.

## Overview

The BlogPost website is a simple blogging platform where users can create, publish, and interact with blog posts. It provides a RESTful API backend built with Node.js and Express, allowing for CRUD operations on posts and comments.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (with Mongoose)
  
- **Frontend** (potentially):
  - React.js

## Features

- **Post Management**:
  - Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for blog posts.
  - Mark posts as published or unpublished.

- **Comment System**:
  - Users can leave comments on blog posts.
  - CRUD operations for comments.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB database.
4. Configure environment variables (if any).
5. Start the server using `npm start`.

## Learning Goals

This project serves as a practical learning experience for:

- Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express.
- Integrating MongoDB as a NoSQL database using Mongoose.
- Implementing CRUD operations for managing data.
- Potentially integrating a frontend using React for a full-stack application experience.
